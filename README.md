# E.Sun - Credit Card Fraud Detection

Submission for AI CUP 2023 E.Sun Artificial Intelligence Open Challenge - Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Method Overview

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the provided data to prepare it for model training.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating new features that enhance the models' ability to detect fraudulent activities.
3. Model Development: Building machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) to effectively classify transactions as genuine or fraudulent.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the models to achieve optimal performance.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using F1-Score.
6. Ensemble Method: Combine the results from each model using max voting to make further generalization, preventing overfitting and improving further prediction.

## File Content

- ```Model/```
	- ```model.py```: Stores code for hyparameter tuning by GridSearchCV, and code for training and predicting using the models.
- ```Preprocess/```
	- ```preprocess.py```: Stores code for data cleaning and preprocessing. Also contains code for feature engineering.
- ```requirements.txt```: Required packages for the code.
- ```main.py```: Execute this file to perform the entire complete process.

 ## Implementation Process Example

 ```
# Install required packages
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 

# Run code
$ python main.py
```
Use ```python -W "ignore" main.py``` to ignore warnings

## Important Notes

- Please put the datasets ('training.csv', 'public_processed.csv', 'public.csv', and 'private_1_processed.csv') into the ```data/``` directory.
- In our code, the provided training dataset will be referred to as the "training data", the public leaderboard dataset will be referred to as the "validation data", and the private leaderboard dataset will be reffered to as the "testing data".
